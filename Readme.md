WIP maybe I'll write something here later

originally (very long ago) based on https://github.com/ShartygeeAnon/WarThunderControlSchemes, but majority of bindings have been changed except MEC and sim stuff
general ideas I've tried to stick to:
  - unmodified `KEY`: very frequently accessed functions, flaps, scouting, etc
  - `ALT + KEY`: majority of less frequently used but important functions live here
  - `CAPS + KEY`: almost exclusively radar controls, plus a few things you don't want to hit by mistake (jettison weapons)
  - `LCTRL + KEY`: things that are exclusive to ground vehicles and don't have equivalents in other modes since `LTRCL` and `LSHIFT` control speed there (suspension, entrenching, etc)
  - `MODIFIER + E` for going faster,`MODIFIER + Q` for by analogy with ground cruise control for things like wing sweep/thrust vector/etc
  
NOTE: I have my mouse scroll speed/dpi switch button bound to `\` in WT - you'll want to either set yours up like that or rebind the controls that are using it (weapon lock and a few other important things). I also have a thumb button that's remapped to `NUM 0`, but it's only used for infrequently accessed things like switching control mode so using the actual `NUM 0` key works fine too (you DO have a numpad RIGHT?).


todo:
- fix up camera controls (fkeys I guess + deal with plane/heli camera differences)
- figure out sim stuff
