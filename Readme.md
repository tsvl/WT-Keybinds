WIP maybe I'll write something here later

originally (very long ago) based on https://github.com/ShartygeeAnon/WarThunderControlSchemes, but majority of bindings have been changed except MEC and sim stuff

todo:
- fix up camera controls (fkeys I guess + deal with plane/heli camera differences)
- figure out sim stuff
